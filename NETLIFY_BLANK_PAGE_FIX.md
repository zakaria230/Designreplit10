# Fixing Blank Pages on Netlify Deployment

If your DesignKorv deployment on Netlify is showing a blank page despite a successful build, follow this troubleshooting guide to identify and resolve the issue.

## Common Causes of Blank Pages

1. **Module Loading Issues**: ESM/CommonJS compatibility problems
2. **Missing Environment Variables**: Required configuration not set in Netlify
3. **Database Connection Errors**: Database URL or credentials issues
4. **Asset Path Problems**: Incorrect path references to CSS, JS, or image files
5. **Client-Side Routing Conflicts**: SPA routing not properly configured with Netlify

## Quick Fixes

Try these quick fixes before diving into more complex solutions:

1. **Check the Browser Console** (F12 > Console) for error messages
2. **Access the Diagnostic Endpoints**:
   - `/diagnose` - General application diagnostics
   - `/_debug` - Detailed system information
   - `/db-check` - Database connection test
   - `/fallback` - Fallback page with troubleshooting info
3. **Verify Environment Variables** in Netlify dashboard
4. **Clear Browser Cache** or try in a private/incognito window

## Detailed Solutions

### 1. ESM/CommonJS Compatibility Issues

The most common cause of blank pages is module loading incompatibility. DesignKorv uses ES Modules, but some Netlify functions require CommonJS.

To fix:

1. Use the updated build script that handles compatibility:
   ```bash
   CI=false node build-for-production.cjs
   ```

2. Check your `netlify.toml` file includes:
   ```toml
   [functions]
     directory = "netlify/functions"
     node_bundler = "esbuild"
   ```

3. Make sure you have the `esbuild.config.js` file in your `netlify/functions` directory.

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set in Netlify:

- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Secret for session encryption
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` - For payment processing
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` - For PayPal integration

To verify environment variables are properly loaded, visit the `/_debug` endpoint after deployment.

### 3. Database Connection Issues

If the database connection is failing:

1. Visit `/db-check` to test the database connection
2. Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` is correctly formatted
3. Check if your database provider (e.g., Neon) allows connections from Netlify's IP range
4. Try adding `?sslmode=require` to your database URL if using Neon or similar providers

### 4. Asset Loading Problems

If assets aren't loading correctly:

1. Make sure `<base href="/" />` is in your HTML `<head>`
2. Verify the `dist/client/_redirects` file exists with proper routing rules
3. Check if the `index.html` is being properly served for all routes

### 5. Diagnostic Tools

DesignKorv includes several diagnostic tools to help troubleshoot deployment issues:

- **Diagnostic CSS**: Provides visual feedback when the page is essentially empty
- **Fallback HTML**: A simple HTML page that loads when the main app fails
- **Diagnostic Endpoints**: Server-side functions that return system information

## Advanced Troubleshooting

If the quick fixes don't resolve the issue:

1. **Examine Netlify Function Logs** in the Netlify dashboard
2. **Deploy with Draft URL** to test changes without affecting production
3. **Compare Local vs Deployed** by running the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build && node build-for-production.cjs
   ```
   Then serve the build locally to see if the issue is environment-specific:
   ```bash
   npx serve dist/client
   ```

4. **Check for Path-Specific Issues** by trying different routes:
   - Home page: `/`
   - Shop: `/shop`
   - Product detail: `/product/[any-slug]`
   - Login: `/auth`

## Getting More Help

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these solutions:

1. Gather diagnostic information from `/_debug` and `/diagnose` endpoints
2. Check the browser console for specific error messages
3. Review Netlify's function logs for server-side errors

## Final Recommendations

To ensure the most reliable deployment:

1. Always use the latest build script: `node build-for-production.cjs`
2. Set all required environment variables
3. Verify database connectivity before and after deployment
4. Use the diagnostic endpoints to quickly identify issues
